## Project Status

We are currently in the pre-alpha phase.  
Everything is subject to change.

## FAQ

### Who are you?

We are some friends who just want to start a project on their own. After a short period of reflection we decided to start this game.

### What are you doing?

We are developing a game inspired by Minecraft, Cube World and other similar games. But we're not just trying to create a clone, we're trying to create something of our own.
We then looked at the two game engines "Unreal" and "Unity" and after a short evaluation period we decided to stay with the Unity Engine.

### How can I best follow the project?

We have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/H8TE9Dy) where you can follow the development of the project.
Of course, you can also include this repository in your watchlist, so you'll be kept up to date.

### How did you come up with the name?

[ST-DDT](https://github.com/ST-DDT) and [Shinigami92](https://github.com/Shinigami92) wanted to work together on a hobby project. We collected some ideas and decided to create a voxel-based game.
When we created the Github repository, we needed a name and we pondered about it for about 20 minutes.
After some names that were more or less too general, we somehow came to the word "Snaux". We briefly entered all the terms into Google to see if they weren't already used in any way.
Snaux is actually a word in the [urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=snaux%20day). A Snaux day is a day you have to work on, but from home. So maybe you can spend such a day with our game :P
That's why it should be a world where you can explore, research and experience adventures.
